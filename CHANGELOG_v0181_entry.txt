### v0.18.1 (2026-02-08) — Bugfix Release

**Backend Fixes:**
- Fixed crash on `/api/models/{id}/mesh` — removed unresolvable ForeignKey constraints on `submitted_by`/`approved_by` columns in models.py (User model defined in main.py, not models.py)

**Frontend Fixes:**
- Fixed `atPrinterLimit is not a function` crash on Printers page — replaced undefined function call with inline Community tier logic
- Fixed `failureModal is not defined` crash on Jobs page — moved state declaration from JobRow to Jobs component
- Fixed `handleDragEnd is not defined` crash on Jobs page — moved drag state and handlers from JobRow to Jobs component
- Fixed printer cards flashing online/offline — WebSocket `last_seen` timestamp had double-Z format (`2026-02-08T20:26:09.123ZZ`), now matches backend SQLite format
- Fixed filament slot display inconsistencies — hex colors no longer shown as names, casing normalized between Dashboard and Printers pages
- Removed non-functional 3D model viewer button — gcode .3mf exports don't contain mesh geometry

**Moonraker/Klipper Parity:**
- Added WebSocket push to frontend for Klipper printer telemetry (real-time card updates)
- Added MQTT republish support for Klipper printers (Home Assistant/Grafana integration)
- Added remaining time calculation for Klipper prints (was hardcoded None)
- Added progress and layer data to WebSocket push for Klipper printers
